# mruby-raylib

Bindings for using Raylib with mruby. Auto-generated using my [binding generator](https://github.com/realtradam/FelBind) however it still under development so some functions are unbound or bound incorrectly.

There are also manually created bindings under the master branch, those were the bindings used in our [gamejam submission](https://github.com/realtradam/orc-arena-of-time).
Only the Raylib functions we needed for building the game were bound to mruby.
